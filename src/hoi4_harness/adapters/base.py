"""The adapter contract: everything the harness needs from "a running game".

HOI4 ships no API. Every real adapter is therefore an approximation, and each one
sees a different subset of the world. The contract below is written so an adapter
can be honest about that: ``capabilities()`` says which actions it can actually
perform, and ``read_state()`` marks what it could not observe instead of
inventing a zero.
