"""Write-side sink: perform actions by driving keyboard and mouse.

Status: skeleton. The mechanics (focus the window, move, click, hotkey) are
straightforward. What is not straightforward, and what this file is structured
around, is that a blind click is unverifiable: every action should act, re-read,
and confirm the state actually changed, reporting failure rather than assuming
success.

Hotkeys are far more reliable than coordinates and should be preferred wherever
the game exposes one. Coordinates are resolution- and UI-scale-dependent and
belong in a calibration file, not in code; ``load_calibration`` fills
``InputConfig.coordinates`` from that file and refuses one captured at another
resolution.
