"""UI scripts: how the input driver performs an action, and how it knows it worked.

A blind click reported as success is the worst failure in this design: the agent
plans on top of a change that never happened. So every scripted action is two
halves, kept apart on purpose:

* **the click path** -- press this hotkey, click that calibrated target, type
  the focus id into the search box. It depends on the game version, the UI
  scale and the operator's layout, so, like coordinates, it lives in a file
  the operator records against their own game (``ui_scripts.json``), never in
  code. Steps may carry ``{placeholders}`` filled from the action's arguments.
* **the verification** -- what must be true of the game state afterwards. That
  does not depend on the UI at all (a started focus is running; a queued
  building lengthens the queue), so it lives here, in code, with tests.

After the steps run, the driver re-reads the game through its reader and polls
until the verification passes or a timeout expires. It reports failure rather
than success when the UI was in an unexpected state -- and reports
*unverified*, never success, when the reader cannot see the field that would
prove it (the log-tail bridge does not emit the focus yet, for one).
