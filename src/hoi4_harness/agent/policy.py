"""The cheap layer: decide whether this moment is worth a model call at all.

HOI4 runs in real time and most of that time is empty. A loop that asks a model
"what now?" every game-day would spend a fortune to answer "keep building" nine
hundred times. So the harness splits control in two:

* **Reflex** -- deterministic Python that handles the obvious and the urgent
  (queue empty, factories idle, pause when something explodes). Free, instant.
* **Planner** -- the LLM, woken only at decision points: a focus finished, a
  research slot opened, a war started, a front broke, or the scheduled review
  came round.

The wake rule is the whole cost model of this project. Widening it is how a run
gets expensive; the defaults below put a 1936-1939 campaign in the low hundreds
of model calls.

There is deliberately no third layer between these two. A cheap model triaging
whether the planner is worth waking has to read the same brief to judge, so it
pays nearly the same input cost -- and input is where the money goes. Measured on
a live 12-turn run: 39,294 input tokens against 2,698 output. Prompt caching has
already made a planner wake cheap; a gatekeeper in front of it would save a
fraction of 6% of the bill, in exchange for a second provider surface and a
second, invisible wake rule. If that trade ever looks worth making, measure it
first -- the numbers above are how.
