"""Many seeds, one claim: report the spread, not a single run.

One run of one scenario against one model is an anecdote. The mock is
deterministic for a fixed seed, but the model is not, and neither is a real
game. So a result meant to be quoted is N runs of the same (model, scenario,
control mode) at different seeds, reported as a median with its range.

What varies between seeds is what the harness can vary: the mock's RNG (and,
once the harness drives a real game, the game's own). A model sampling at
temperature varies on its own.

Rule of thumb, repeated in docs/customization.md: a claim that goes in a README
needs at least five seeds, and "A beats B" needs A's worst run to beat B's
median at the very least -- ranges that overlap heavily are a tie, whatever the
medians say.
