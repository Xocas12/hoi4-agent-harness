"""Advisor mode: the model recommends and nothing executes.

The tests hold the two promises the feature makes. First, a run in advisor mode
cannot change the game -- asserted on adapter state, never on a flag. Second,
the model is never left believing it acted: the tool result says so in plain
words, and the note it wrote still comes back to it.
